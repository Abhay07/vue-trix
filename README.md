```

## Features

## Mount

### Mount with global

in the `main.js`, import the package as a global component.

```javascript
  import 'vue-trix'
```

### Mount with component

```javascript
  import VueTrix from 'vue-trix'

  export default {
    // ...
    components: {
      VueTrix
    }
  }
```

## Component Usages

### Create a simple editor

Add `VueTrix` component into `*.vue` template

```XML
  <template>
    <!-- ... -->
    <VueTrix v-model="editorContent" placeholder="Enter content" localStorage/>
    <!-- ... -->
  </template>
```

### Integrating with Forms

```XML
  <form ...>
    <VueTrix inputId="editor1" v-model="editorContent" placeholder="enter your content..."/>
  </form>
```

#### Props descriptions

- `inputId`: This is referenced `id` of the hidden input field defined
- `placeholder`: The placeholder attribute specifies a short hint that describes the expected value of a editor
- `localStorage`: Boolean attribute allows saving editor state into browser's localStorage

### Binding editor changes

The `<VueTrix/>` element emits several events which you can use to observe and respond to changes in editor state.

- `@trix-attachment-add` fires after an attachment is added to the document. You can access the Trix attachment object through the attachment property on the event. If the attachment object has a file property, you should store this file remotely and set the attachmentâ€™s URL attribute.

- `@trix-attachment-remove` fires when an attachment is removed from the document. You can access the Trix attachment object through the attachment property on the event. You may wish to use this event to clean up remotely stored files.
